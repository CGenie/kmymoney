/**
 * @brief Enables onlineTask meta system
 *
 * Use ONLINETASK_META in your onlineTask derived class to create an onlineTask type iid
 * (the name). This is should be like the plugin iid of Qt5 (ONLINATASK_META was written
 * for Qt4).
 *
 * @param onlineTaskSubClass the class type (e.g. onlineTask)
 * @param IID A unique name for the task, should be replaced by IID of Qt5 plugins
 *
 * \section onlineTaskMeta The onlineTask Meta System
 *
 * To prevent accidently using a super-class if sub-class should be used, the onlineTasks
 * have a meta system. Each onlineTask has an iid which can be requested with a virtual
 * method or a static method.
 *
 * The task @b IID (type @c QString) is constant after a restart and set by the programmer.
 * \code
 * // get the name of a known type
 * onlineTask::name()
 * // get the name of a pointer
 * onlineTask* unknownTask = new onlineTaskSubClass();
 * unknownTask->taskName();
 * \endcode
 *
 * Activate the meta system using ONLINETASK_META() in your classes public section.

/**
 * @brief The onlineTask class
 *
 * @notice This docu describes the inteded way of the onlineTask/Job system. The loading during runtime or plugin
 * infrastructure is not realized yet (and needs further changes at the storage). The docu is just forward compatible.
 * 
 * Everything an onlinePlugin can do is represented as a task. Due to the huge amount of possible onlineTasks
 * they are loaded during runtime. Which also allows a third party online plugin to introduce its own
 * tasks. However tasks are seperated from the onlinePlugins to allow more than one plugin to use the same task.
 * 
 * The widgets to edit an onlineTask are created by subclassing @a IonlineJobEdit. To enable KMyMoney to convert
 * one task into another use @a onlineTaskConverter.
 * 
 * @important Do not delete onlineTasks or use pointers to onlineTasks directly. Use onlineJob instead!
 * This prevents common C++ pitfalls.
 * 
 * If you inherit onlineTask, take care of clone() and \ref onlineTaskMeta.
 * Maybe you want to look at @ref onlineTask::settings as well.
